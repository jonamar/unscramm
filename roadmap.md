unordered backlog:
- a simple way to gather suggestions or feedback in the app. mvp: a link to github issues page.
- some simple gamification mechanisms (ex count of total animations run and total custom words. a history of word usage. later: something like an average word difficulty score to track spelling improvements over time) 
    - could be used as a KPI to track app success
- a light mode


notes to self:
- currently working on task 3 (3.5 next)
- before you work on step 4 make sure to expand it. (or at least check if it's expanded)

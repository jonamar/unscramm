# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Letter component for character animations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Letter component that handles individual character animations with appropriate styling and accessibility.
# Details:
Develop a reusable Letter component that represents a single character in the animation sequence. Integrate Framer Motion for animations. The component should handle different states (normal, deletion, insertion, movement) with appropriate color coding (red for deletions, green for insertions, yellow for moves) as specified in the PRD. Ensure the component is accessible with proper ARIA attributes and supports keyboard focus states. Use CSS Modules for styling according to the styleguide.md specifications.

# Test Strategy:
Test the Letter component with React Testing Library, verifying it renders correctly in different states and animates as expected. Check accessibility with axe-core testing library.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic Letter component structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational structure of the Letter component with proper props typing and basic rendering functionality.
### Details:
Create a new Letter.tsx component with TypeScript interfaces for props including character, animationState (normal, deletion, insertion, movement), and any callback functions. Implement basic rendering of the character in a span element. Set up the CSS Module file structure following styleguide.md specifications with placeholder classes.

## 2. Implement state-based styling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add CSS styling for different letter states with appropriate color coding based on animation state.
### Details:
Enhance the CSS Module with styles for each animation state: normal (default), deletion (red), insertion (green), and movement (yellow) as specified in the PRD. Create style variations that apply the correct colors, transitions, and visual treatments for each state. Ensure the component applies the correct class based on the current animationState prop.

## 3. Integrate Framer Motion animations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add Framer Motion to the Letter component to handle smooth transitions between states and animation effects.
### Details:
Replace the basic span element with Framer Motion's motion.span. Implement animation variants for each state (normal, deletion, insertion, movement). Configure appropriate transition properties (duration, easing) for smooth animations. Ensure animations trigger correctly when the animationState prop changes.

## 4. Implement accessibility features [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the Letter component with proper accessibility attributes and keyboard focus states.
### Details:
Add appropriate ARIA attributes to the Letter component based on its current state. Implement keyboard focus states with visible focus indicators. Ensure the component is properly announced by screen readers, especially during state transitions. Add aria-live attributes if necessary for dynamic changes. Update the CSS to include focus state styling that complies with WCAG standards.

## 5. Optimize performance and finalize component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize the Letter component for performance and finalize it for production use.
### Details:
Implement React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Add proper cleanup for any animation effects or event listeners. Document the component API with JSDoc comments. Create storybook stories showcasing different states and animations. Ensure the component works correctly in all required browser environments. Perform final review against PRD requirements.

## 6. Implement e2e testing for animations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create end-to-end tests to verify animation behavior from a user perspective
### Details:

## 7. Improve Letter component animation test infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Refine the testing approach for Framer Motion animations to make tests more robust, faster, and maintainable
### Details:
Based on code review feedback, implement several improvements to the Letter component animation tests:

1. Move the Framer Motion mock to a dedicated `__mocks__` folder for proper Jest resolution
2. Simplify the mock to use a basic element that forwards all props automatically
3. Add transition tests to verify state changes between animation states
4. Implement a test environment flag to zero-out animation durations for faster and more deterministic tests
5. Ensure tests focus on observable behavior rather than implementation details

These changes will improve test reliability, maintainability and performance across both unit and E2E tests.

## 8. Scaffold Storybook visual-test runner [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure .storybook/main.ts with the test addon and add npm run storybook:test script
### Details:
â€¢ Configure .storybook/main.ts with the test addon\nâ€¢ Add npm run storybook:test script

## 9. Create baseline stories & initial snapshots [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write Letter.stories.tsx with Normal, Insertion, Deletion, Movement and capture/update snapshots locally
### Details:
â€¢ Write Letter.stories.tsx with Normal, Insertion, Deletion, Movement\nâ€¢ Capture/update snapshots locally (--updateSnapshots)

## 10. Add reduced-motion variant tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: In stories toggle prefers-reduced-motion: reduce and snapshot 'no-motion' renders
### Details:
â€¢ In stories toggle prefers-reduced-motion: reduce\nâ€¢ Snapshot "no-motion" renders
<info added on 2025-05-04T22:37:29.821Z>
â€¢ In stories toggle prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
â€¢ Snapshot "no-motion" renders

Implementation details:

1. Added a set of stories specifically for reduced motion variants
   - Created a ReducedMotionWrapper component that simulates 'prefers-reduced-motion: reduce' media query
   - Added variants for all animation states: normal, insertion, deletion, movement, and all states combined

2. Updated the test-runner.js to better handle snapshots
   - Modified snapshot naming convention to include motion preference (normal-motion vs reduced-motion)
   - Added a tolerance threshold for visual comparisons (1%)
   - Added logging to track which snapshots were captured

3. Generated snapshots for all variants
   - Confirmed that reduced motion snapshots are created and stored correctly
   - Visual inspection shows the expected differences between normal and reduced motion displays

4. Technical approach:
   - Used CSS @media query overrides to force reduced motion mode in the stories
   - Leveraged the existing useReducedMotion hook from Framer Motion that's already in the Letter component
   - Created a visual indicator in the UI showing when reduced motion mode is active

This implementation ensures the Letter component behaves appropriately for users with motion sensitivity and provides a testing infrastructure to prevent regressions.

   - This gives immediate linting feedback without slowing down workflow
   - Fast enough to run on every commit
   - Automatically fixes simple issues

3. **Maintained pre-push hook for thorough validation**:
   - Kept existing config that runs Storybook tests
   - Visual tests only run when pushing code
   - Uses parallel execution for optimal performance

# Task ID: 11
# Title: Fix Storybook Dependency Issue with Missing @storybook/builder-webpack5
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the Storybook startup failure by updating the configuration to use Vite instead of webpack5, ensuring compatibility with React 19 and the experimental-nextjs-vite framework for proper component visualization. Additionally, fix PostCSS configuration issues causing component rendering problems by installing and properly configuring the dedicated @tailwindcss/postcss package.
# Details:
1. Document the current error message and Storybook version being used in the project.
2. Identify the root cause: The configuration in `.storybook/main.ts` was using webpack5 as the builder, which is not compatible with React 19 and the experimental-nextjs-vite framework.
3. Modify the `.storybook/main.ts` file to:
   - Remove the webpack5 builder configuration
   - Add the Vite configuration with `disableTelemetry: true`
   - Add a `viteFinal` function to extend Vite config if needed
4. Verify that the application is running correctly with the updated configuration.
5. After fixing the Storybook startup issue, address the component rendering problem:
   - Identify the PostCSS configuration error causing infinite scrollers instead of proper component rendering
   - The specific error message indicated: "[plugin:vite:css] looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The correct plugin has moved to a separate package..."
   - Install the correct PostCSS plugin packages: `npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss autoprefixer`
   - Update the `postcss.config.mjs` file to use proper imports:
     ```js
     import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/postcss';
     import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';
     
     export default {
       plugins: [
         tailwindcss,
         autoprefixer,
       ]
     };
     ```
   - This change follows current best practices for using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS, requiring the dedicated `@tailwindcss/postcss` package rather than directly using `tailwindcss` as a plugin
6. Note that no additional dependencies need to be installed for the Vite configuration as the project is already using the experimental-nextjs-vite framework, which is compatible with React 19.
7. Document the changes made to both the Storybook and PostCSS configurations for future reference.
8. Note that there are still some issues with the test runner, but these are related to the test-runner configuration rather than the core Storybook setup and would require a separate task.

# Test Strategy:
1. After implementing the changes, run the Storybook startup command (npm run storybook or yarn storybook) and verify it starts without dependency errors.
2. Confirm that Storybook is properly using Vite instead of webpack5 in the startup logs.
3. Verify that all existing stories load correctly in the Storybook interface without infinite scrollers or rendering issues.
4. Confirm that CSS styling (including Tailwind classes) is properly applied to components in Storybook.
5. Test navigation between different component stories to ensure the UI is functioning properly.
6. Check that component interactions (like button clicks, form inputs) work as expected within Storybook.
7. Test Storybook in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
8. Verify that any addons previously used still function correctly.
9. Have another team member clone the repository and start Storybook to confirm the fix works in a fresh environment.
10. Document the resolution process and update the project's README or development setup guide with the new Vite configuration details and PostCSS configuration requirements.
11. Create a small test story if needed to verify that new components can be properly added and visualized with correct styling.
12. Note any test-runner issues encountered but do not attempt to fix them as part of this task.
13. Specifically verify that the "Invalid PostCSS Plugin" error is resolved and no infinite scrolling indicators appear in Storybook.

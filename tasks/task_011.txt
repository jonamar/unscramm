# Title: Fix Storybook Dependency Issue with Missing @storybook/builder-webpack5
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the Storybook startup failure caused by missing @storybook/builder-webpack5 dependency by researching, installing required packages, and updating configuration files to ensure proper component visualization.
# Details:
1. First, document the current error message and Storybook version being used in the project.
2. Research the compatibility requirements for the current Storybook version, particularly focusing on webpack dependencies.
3. Install the missing @storybook/builder-webpack5 package using npm or yarn (matching the project's package manager).
4. Check for additional related dependencies that might be required, such as @storybook/manager-webpack5.
5. Update the Storybook configuration files (.storybook/main.js) to properly reference the webpack5 builder.
6. Review the package.json file to ensure all peer dependencies are satisfied.
7. Check for any deprecated configurations or APIs that might need updating based on the Storybook version.
8. If upgrading Storybook versions is necessary, follow the migration guide to ensure all configuration changes are properly implemented.
9. Document any changes made to dependencies and configurations for future reference.
10. Consider adding these dependencies to the project's documentation to prevent similar issues in the future.

# Test Strategy:
1. After implementing the changes, run the Storybook startup command (npm run storybook or yarn storybook) and verify it starts without dependency errors.
2. Confirm that the webpack5 builder is properly recognized in the startup logs.
3. Verify that all existing stories load correctly in the Storybook interface.
4. Test navigation between different component stories to ensure the UI is functioning properly.
5. Check that component interactions (like button clicks, form inputs) work as expected within Storybook.
6. Test Storybook in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
7. Verify that any addons previously used still function correctly.
8. Have another team member clone the repository and start Storybook to confirm the fix works in a fresh environment.
9. Document the resolution process and update the project's README or development setup guide with any new requirements.
10. Create a small test story if needed to verify that new components can be properly added and visualized.

# Description: Enhance the application with accessibility features to meet WCAG standards and support diverse users.
# Details:
Implement accessibility features throughout the application: 1) Ensure proper keyboard navigation and focus management, 2) Add ARIA attributes to all interactive elements, 3) Implement color-blind friendly palettes as alternative themes, 4) Add screen reader support with descriptive text for animations, 5) Ensure sufficient color contrast according to WCAG standards, 6) Add skip-to-content links and proper heading hierarchy. Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct an accessibility audit using axe-core. Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver). Verify keyboard navigation works properly. Check color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards. Test with color blindness simulators.

# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Visual Design from Styleguide
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Apply the proper visual design from styleguide.md to the main application, replacing generic Tailwind classes with the specific design specifications defined in design_guidelines/styleguide.md.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the sophisticated neumorphic design specified in the styleguide throughout the application:

1. Color Palette Implementation:
   - Replace current dark theme with the specific color palette (#111 for background, #181818 for panels)
   - Create CSS variables for all colors defined in the styleguide for consistent usage
   - Apply proper color contrasts for accessibility compliance

2. Typography Integration:
   - Import and configure Istok Web font family (regular, bold, italic variants)
   - Set up proper font sizing hierarchy as specified in the styleguide
   - Implement consistent line heights and letter spacing
   - Create typography utility classes for reuse across components

3. Neumorphic Button Styling:
   - Replace generic button styles with the neumorphic design
   - Implement proper shadow effects (inner and outer shadows)
   - Add hover, active, and focus states with appropriate transitions
   - Ensure buttons maintain accessibility standards with proper contrast

4. Input Panel Styling:
   - Apply the specified shadow effects and border treatments
   - Implement focus states with appropriate visual feedback
   - Ensure proper padding and spacing within input components
   - Add any specified animations or transitions for interaction states

5. Layout Implementation:
   - Enforce 600px max-width constraint for the main content area
   - Create a centered layout with proper margins
   - Implement proper spacing between components according to the styleguide
   - Ensure consistent padding and margin usage throughout the application

6. Responsive Design Implementation:
   - Configure the breakpoints specified in the styleguide
   - Test and adjust layouts for each breakpoint
   - Implement any specific mobile/tablet adaptations mentioned in the styleguide
   - Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized on mobile devices

7. Create a theme.css or equivalent file that centralizes all design tokens and can be imported globally
   - Document usage patterns for the design system
   - Create reusable utility classes for common design patterns

8. Update all existing components to use the new styling:
   - WordTransform component
   - Controls component
   - Letter component
   - Main application page

The implementation should maintain all existing functionality while enhancing the visual appearance to match the specified design.

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual Inspection:
   - Compare the implemented design against the styleguide.md specifications
   - Verify all color values match exactly using browser developer tools
   - Confirm typography settings (font family, sizes, weights) match the specifications
   - Validate that neumorphic effects are properly implemented on buttons and panels

2. Responsive Testing:
   - Test the application at each breakpoint specified in the styleguide
   - Verify the layout maintains 600px max-width and centers appropriately
   - Confirm the design adapts correctly at mobile breakpoints
   - Test on actual devices (phones, tablets) if possible

3. Accessibility Verification:
   - Run automated accessibility tests to ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
   - Verify that focus states are clearly visible for keyboard navigation
   - Test with screen readers to ensure the enhanced styling doesn't impact accessibility
   - Validate that interactive elements maintain proper touch/click targets

4. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify the design renders consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Check that neumorphic effects and shadows render properly in all supported browsers
   - Test on both Windows and macOS to ensure font rendering is consistent

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare page load times before and after styling changes
   - Verify that animations and transitions maintain 60fps performance
   - Check for any CSS bloat or unnecessary style duplication

6. Code Review:
   - Verify CSS organization follows best practices
   - Confirm the use of variables/tokens for consistent styling
   - Check that the implementation uses the most efficient selectors
   - Ensure no inline styles are used that would override the design system

7. User Testing:
   - Gather feedback on the new design implementation
   - Verify that users can still easily interact with all controls
   - Confirm the design enhances rather than detracts from usability

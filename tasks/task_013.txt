# Task ID: 13
# Title: Fix LocalWordPairService Dictionary Loading Issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the path resolution and loading issues in the LocalWordPairService that prevent proper access to the wordPairs.json dictionary file in both development and production environments. This is a blocking issue for the shuffle functionality, which is a core PRD requirement.
# Details:
1. Investigate the current implementation of LocalWordPairService to identify the root cause of the "Failed to load word pairs dictionary: Not Found" errors.

2. Fix the path resolution issue:
   - Update the service to correctly reference the dictionary file at `public/data/wordPairs.json` instead of `/data/wordPairs.json`
   - Implement proper path resolution that works across different environments (development, testing, production)
   - Consider using Next.js's built-in public folder handling for static assets

3. Implement robust error handling:
   - Add proper error catching and logging for dictionary loading failures
   - Implement a fallback mechanism (e.g., default word pairs) in case the dictionary cannot be loaded
   - Add retry logic if appropriate

4. Update the fetch mechanism:
   - Use the appropriate Next.js methods for accessing static files
   - Ensure the fetch is compatible with both client and server-side rendering scenarios
   - Consider caching strategies to improve performance

5. Refactor the service to handle different environments:
   - Add environment detection to adjust paths if needed
   - Ensure the service works in both development and production builds
   - Document any environment-specific considerations

6. Update any related components or services that might be affected by these changes
   - Ensure the shuffle functionality properly integrates with the fixed service
   - Verify that all consumers of the WordPairService interface still work correctly

7. Prioritize this fix as it's currently blocking the shuffle functionality, which prevents users from experiencing random word pairs - a core feature in the PRD

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Create unit tests for the LocalWordPairService that verify it can load the dictionary file
   - Test error handling by simulating missing or corrupted dictionary files
   - Verify that the service correctly parses and returns word pairs from the dictionary

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the integration between the LocalWordPairService and components that use it
   - Verify that the shuffle functionality works correctly with the loaded dictionary
   - Test the service in different rendering contexts (SSR, CSR, etc.)

3. Environment Testing:
   - Test the service in development environment using `npm run dev`
   - Test in a production-like environment using `npm run build` followed by `npm run start`
   - Verify dictionary loading works in both environments

4. Error Scenario Testing:
   - Test recovery from network failures
   - Test behavior when the dictionary file is missing or malformed
   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed to users

5. Manual Verification:
   - Check browser console for any loading errors related to the dictionary
   - Verify the shuffle functionality works end-to-end in the application
   - Test on different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility

6. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and verify that dictionary loading doesn't impact application startup time
   - Check that caching mechanisms work as expected

7. Validation Testing:
   - Specifically verify that the shuffle functionality works correctly after the fix
   - Confirm that users can experience random word pairs as intended in the PRD

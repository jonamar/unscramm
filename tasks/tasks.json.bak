Complexity Reduction in localWordPairService.ts:\n   - Refactor the loadDictionary() method (current complexity: 16) by:\n     - Extracting file reading logic into a separate function\n     - Creating a dedicated parsing function for dictionary entries\n     - Moving validation logic to its own helper function\n   - Simplify the getRandomPair() method (current complexity: 11) by:\n     - Extracting the filtering logic to a separate function\n     - Creating a dedicated random selection helper\n     - Removing nested conditionals where possible\n\n2. Dead Code Removal:\n   - Address the findLCSPositionsFromStrings function in editPlan.ts by either:\n     - Implementing it properly if needed for future functionality\n     - Removing it completely if unused\n   - Clean up flipUtils.ts by:\n     - Removing unnecessary ESLint disable comments\n     - Eliminating stray expressions that don't contribute to functionality\n     - Consolidating duplicate logic\n\n3. Documentation Improvements:\n   - Add JSDoc comments to all refactored functions\n   - Document the reasoning behind complex algorithms\n   - Update inline comments to explain non-obvious code sections\n   - Ensure test coverage is maintained by updating any affected tests\n\nThe refactoring should maintain all existing functionality while improving code maintainability.

Add transition tests to verify state changes between animation states\n4. Implement a test environment flag to zero-out animation durations for faster and more deterministic tests\n5.

Added a set of stories specifically for reduced motion variants\n   - Created a ReducedMotionWrapper component that simulates 'prefers-reduced-motion: reduce' media query\n   - Added variants for all animation states: normal, insertion, deletion, movement, and all states combined\n\n2. Updated the test-runner.js to better handle snapshots\n   - Modified snapshot naming convention to include motion preference (normal-motion vs reduced-motion)\n   - Added a tolerance threshold for visual comparisons (1%)\n   - Added logging to track which snapshots were captured\n\n3. Generated snapshots for all variants\n   - Confirmed that reduced motion snapshots are created and stored correctly\n   - Visual inspection shows the expected differences between normal and reduced motion displays\n\n4. Technical approach:\n   - Used CSS @media query overrides to force reduced motion mode in the stories\n   - Leveraged the existing useReducedMotion hook from Framer Motion that's already in the Letter component\n   - Created a visual indicator in the UI showing when reduced motion mode is active\n\nThis implementation ensures the Letter component behaves appropriately for users with motion sensitivity and provides a testing infrastructure to prevent regressions.\n</info added on 2025-05-04T22:37:29.821Z>",

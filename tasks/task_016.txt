# Task ID: 16
# Title: Remove XState Dependency and Reimplement WordTransformFSM with React Hooks
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the WordTransformFSM component to eliminate the XState dependency by reimplementing the state machine logic using native React hooks to resolve compatibility issues with Next.js 15 and React 19.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current XState implementation in wordTransform.machine.ts:
   - Document all states, events, transitions, and actions in the current state machine
   - Map out the complete behavior flow to ensure full feature parity

2. Create a new implementation using React's useReducer hook:
   - Define a reducer function that handles all state transitions previously managed by XState
   - Implement a custom hook (e.g., useWordTransformMachine) that encapsulates the state machine logic
   - Ensure the new hook provides the same API surface as the previous XState implementation
   - Preserve all existing states: idle, typing, checking, success, error

3. Update the WordTransformFSM component:
   - Replace XState imports and useMachine hook with the new custom hook
   - Ensure all component props remain unchanged to maintain backward compatibility
   - Update any internal logic that relied on XState-specific features

4. Refactor related components that interact with WordTransformFSM:
   - Identify any components that directly interact with the state machine
   - Update these components to work with the new hook-based implementation
   - Ensure event handling and state transitions remain consistent

5. Performance considerations:
   - Implement memoization where appropriate using useMemo and useCallback
   - Ensure state updates are optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders

6. Documentation:
   - Add detailed comments explaining the state machine logic
   - Update any existing documentation to reflect the new implementation
   - Document the rationale for removing XState dependency

7. Migration guide:
   - Create a brief guide for any future developers explaining how the new implementation maps to the previous XState version

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Update existing unit tests for wordTransform.machine.ts to test the new reducer and custom hook
   - Verify all state transitions work correctly by testing each possible event in each state
   - Test edge cases and error handling to ensure robustness
   - Use React Testing Library to test the hook implementation in isolation

2. Component Tests:
   - Update tests for the WordTransformFSM component to work with the new implementation
   - Verify that the component renders correctly in all possible states
   - Test all user interactions (typing, submitting, etc.) to ensure they trigger the correct state transitions
   - Confirm that all callbacks and event handlers work as expected

3. Integration Tests:
   - Test the WordTransformFSM component within the context of parent components
   - Verify that data flows correctly between components
   - Ensure that the component interacts properly with any services or contexts

4. Storybook Updates:
   - Update all Storybook stories to work with the new implementation
   - Create stories for each state of the component to visually verify rendering
   - Add interactive stories that demonstrate state transitions

5. End-to-End Tests:
   - Run existing E2E tests to verify that the application works correctly with the new implementation
   - Test the complete user flow to ensure no regressions

6. Performance Testing:
   - Compare render performance between the old XState implementation and the new hook-based implementation
   - Verify that there are no memory leaks or performance regressions

7. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test the implementation across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior
   - Verify that the implementation works correctly in both development and production builds

# Task ID: 17
# Title: Clean Up XState Dependency from Package Files
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove the XState dependency from package.json and package-lock.json files since it's no longer used after the state machine was converted to React hooks in Task 16.
# Details:
This task involves safely removing the XState dependency from the project to reduce bundle size and eliminate potential security vulnerabilities from unused packages:

1. First, verify that Task 16 has been fully completed and all XState imports have been removed from the codebase:
   - Run a project-wide search for any remaining imports from XState: `import * from 'xstate'` or `import { ... } from 'xstate'`
   - Check for any remaining references to XState in comments or documentation
   - Ensure all tests are passing without XState dependencies

2. Remove the XState dependency from package.json:
   - Open package.json and locate the XState entry in the dependencies section
   - Remove the line containing "xstate": "^x.x.x" (where x.x.x is the version number)
   - If there are any XState-related dev dependencies (like @xstate/react or @xstate/test), remove those as well

3. Update package-lock.json by running the appropriate package manager command:
   - For npm: `npm install`
   - For yarn: `yarn`
   - For pnpm: `pnpm install`

4. Verify the dependency has been properly removed:
   - Confirm package-lock.json no longer contains XState-related entries
   - Run `npm ls xstate` (or equivalent for your package manager) to ensure it's not installed as a transitive dependency

5. Update any documentation that references XState:
   - Check README.md and other documentation files for references to XState
   - Update architecture diagrams or technical documentation to reflect the new React hooks implementation

6. Rebuild the application to verify everything works correctly:
   - Run the build process: `npm run build`
   - Verify the build completes successfully without errors
   - Check the bundle size to confirm it has been reduced

7. Document the dependency removal in the project changelog or release notes.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the successful removal of the XState dependency:

1. Static Analysis:
   - Run a codebase search for any remaining imports or references to XState
   - Use a tool like `depcheck` to verify XState is not listed as a dependency: `npx depcheck`
   - Examine the package.json file to confirm XState has been removed

2. Build Verification:
   - Run a clean build of the application: `npm run build`
   - Verify no build errors related to missing XState dependencies
   - Compare bundle size before and after the change to confirm reduction:
     - Use `npm run build -- --analyze` if a bundle analyzer is configured
     - Or install and use `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to compare bundle sizes

3. Runtime Testing:
   - Start the application in development mode: `npm run dev`
   - Test all functionality previously handled by the XState state machine
   - Verify all state transitions and animations work correctly with the React hooks implementation
   - Test edge cases that might have been handled by XState's state machine

4. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Ensure all automated tests pass in the CI pipeline
   - Verify that deployment processes complete successfully

5. Performance Testing:
   - Compare application load times before and after the dependency removal
   - Measure Time to Interactive (TTI) to verify performance improvements

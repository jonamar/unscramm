# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize performance and animation timing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the application to ensure animations start within 50ms of user action and run smoothly across devices.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations to meet the 50ms animation start requirement: 1) Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations, 2) Implement code-splitting with Next.js dynamic imports, 3) Optimize the animation algorithms for efficiency, 4) Add debouncing to user inputs, 5) Implement proper loading states and feedback, 6) Use the React Profiler to identify and fix performance bottlenecks. Benchmark animation start times and optimize until the 50ms requirement is consistently met.

# Test Strategy:
Use the Performance API to measure animation start times. Create performance tests with Lighthouse. Test on various devices and network conditions. Verify smooth animations on both high and low-end devices.

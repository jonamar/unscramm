# Task ID: 19
# Title: Consolidate Duplicate LocalWordPairService Implementations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the old stub implementation in src/services/wordService.ts and ensure all imports use the complete implementation from src/services/localWordPairService.ts to eliminate confusion and potential import issues.
# Details:
1. Identify all files that import from the stub implementation in src/services/wordService.ts:
   - Use IDE search functionality to find all imports referencing "wordService.ts"
   - Document each location where the stub is being imported

2. Analyze the current implementation in src/services/localWordPairService.ts:
   - Ensure it fully implements the WordPairService interface
   - Verify that all methods are properly implemented with actual functionality
   - Check that it correctly handles the dictionary loading (fixed in Task 13)

3. Update all import statements across the codebase:
   - Replace `import { ... } from 'src/services/wordService'` with `import { ... } from 'src/services/localWordPairService'`
   - Ensure any named imports match the exports from localWordPairService.ts
   - Update any type references that might be using the interface from wordService.ts

4. If the WordPairService interface is defined in wordService.ts:
   - Move the interface definition to a new file src/services/types/wordPairService.ts
   - Update all imports to reference the interface from this new location
   - Ensure localWordPairService.ts properly implements this interface

5. Remove the stub implementation:
   - Once all imports are updated, safely delete src/services/wordService.ts
   - Verify no references to this file remain in the codebase

6. Update any service registration or dependency injection:
   - If using any DI container or context providers, update the service registration
   - Ensure the correct implementation is being provided throughout the application

7. Documentation updates:
   - Update any documentation that references the old stub implementation
   - Add comments to the localWordPairService.ts file indicating it's the canonical implementation

# Test Strategy:
1. Static code analysis:
   - Run a project-wide search for any remaining imports of "wordService.ts" to ensure none were missed
   - Verify that src/services/wordService.ts has been completely removed
   - Check that all imports now correctly reference localWordPairService.ts

2. Compilation verification:
   - Run a full TypeScript compilation (tsc) to ensure no type errors exist
   - Verify that the build process completes without errors related to missing imports

3. Runtime testing:
   - Execute all existing unit tests that involve word pair functionality
   - Verify that all features dependent on the WordPairService continue to work correctly
   - Test specifically the functionality that was previously using the stub implementation

4. Integration testing:
   - Test the application end-to-end to ensure all word pair related features work correctly
   - Verify that dictionary loading works properly in both development and production environments
   - Test edge cases like error handling and fallback behavior

5. Regression testing:
   - Ensure that the fixes from Task 13 (dictionary loading) still work correctly
   - Verify that no new issues have been introduced by the consolidation

6. Code review:
   - Have another developer review the changes to ensure all references have been properly updated
   - Verify that the interface implementation in localWordPairService.ts is complete

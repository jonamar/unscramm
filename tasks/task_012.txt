# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Port Management System for Development Servers
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive port management system that prevents port conflicts during development by implementing a centralized configuration approach with validation scripts and documentation.
# Details:
The implementation should include the following components:

1. Create a centralized `.env.ports` configuration file:
   - Define standard port assignments for all services (API, web server, database, Redis, etc.)
   - Include comments explaining each service's port requirements
   - Group related services together for clarity

2. Develop a port validation script (`check-port.js`):
   - Create a Node.js utility that checks if a specified port is available
   - Implement detection of already-in-use ports with clear error messages
   - Add protection against using reserved system ports (0-1023)
   - Include fallback logic to suggest alternative ports when conflicts occur

3. Update npm scripts in package.json:
   - Modify all service startup scripts to use the port management system
   - Create a pre-start hook that validates port availability
   - Add a `ports:list` command to display all configured ports
   - Implement a `ports:check` command to verify all ports are available

4. Create a port reservation system:
   - Implement a temporary port locking mechanism during development
   - Add ability to register/unregister ports in use by specific developers
   - Create conflict resolution strategies for team environments

5. Documentation:
   - Create a dedicated "Port Management" section in the project README
   - Document the process for adding new services with port requirements
   - Include troubleshooting steps for common port conflict scenarios
   - Add examples of custom port configuration for local development

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and usability of the port management system:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the port checking utility with various scenarios (available port, in-use port, reserved port)
   - Verify proper error handling and messaging for different conflict types
   - Test the port suggestion algorithm for appropriate alternatives

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify that all npm scripts correctly utilize the port management system
   - Test concurrent service startup to ensure no conflicts occur
   - Validate that the system correctly loads and applies port configurations

3. Manual Testing Checklist:
   - Start all development services simultaneously and verify no port conflicts
   - Deliberately create a port conflict and verify the system provides clear guidance
   - Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure cross-platform compatibility
   - Verify behavior when a port becomes unavailable after initial validation

4. Documentation Verification:
   - Have a team member unfamiliar with the system follow the documentation to configure a new service
   - Verify all error messages are documented with clear resolution steps
   - Ensure the README accurately reflects the implemented system

5. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test behavior when `.env.ports` is missing or malformed
   - Verify handling of non-numeric port values
   - Test with extremely high port numbers (near 65535)
   - Validate behavior when system is under heavy load with many ports in use

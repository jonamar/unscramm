Complexity Reduction in localWordPairService.ts:\n   - Refactor the loadDictionary() method (current complexity: 16) by:\n     - Extracting file reading logic into a separate function\n     - Creating a dedicated parsing function for dictionary entries\n     - Moving validation logic to its own helper function\n   - Simplify the getRandomPair() method (current complexity: 11) by:\n     - Extracting the filtering logic to a separate function\n     - Creating a dedicated random selection helper\n     - Removing nested conditionals where possible\n\n2. Dead Code Removal:\n   - Address the findLCSPositionsFromStrings function in editPlan.ts by either:\n     - Implementing it properly if needed for future functionality\n     - Removing it completely if unused\n   - Clean up flipUtils.ts by:\n     - Removing unnecessary ESLint disable comments\n     - Eliminating stray expressions that don't contribute to functionality\n     - Consolidating duplicate logic\n\n3. Documentation Improvements:\n   - Add JSDoc comments to all refactored functions\n   - Document the reasoning behind complex algorithms\n   - Update inline comments to explain non-obvious code sections\n   - Ensure test coverage is maintained by updating any affected tests\n\nThe refactoring should maintain all existing functionality while improving code maintainability.

Added a set of stories specifically for reduced motion variants\n   - Created a ReducedMotionWrapper component that simulates 'prefers-reduced-motion: reduce' media query\n   - Added variants for all animation states: normal, insertion, deletion, movement, and all states combined\n\n2. Updated the test-runner.js to better handle snapshots\n   - Modified snapshot naming convention to include motion preference (normal-motion vs reduced-motion)\n   - Added a tolerance threshold for visual comparisons (1%)\n   - Added logging to track which snapshots were captured\n\n3. Generated snapshots for all variants\n   - Confirmed that reduced motion snapshots are created and stored correctly\n   - Visual inspection shows the expected differences between normal and reduced motion displays\n\n4. Technical approach:\n   - Used CSS @media query overrides to force reduced motion mode in the stories\n   - Leveraged the existing useReducedMotion hook from Framer Motion that's already in the Letter component\n   - Created a visual indicator in the UI showing when reduced motion mode is active\n\nThis implementation ensures the Letter component behaves appropriately for users with motion sensitivity and provides a testing infrastructure to prevent regressions.\n</info added on 2025-05-04T22:37:29.821Z>",

Create stories that showcase each animation phase (idle, deleting, inserting, transitioning) and verify the visual appearance and behavior matches the expected design. Use Storybook's interaction testing capabilities to simulate user interactions and animation triggers. Implement visual regression tests using Chromatic or a similar tool to catch unintended visual changes. This dual testing approach (unit tests + visual testing) will ensure both the functional logic and visual appearance are correctly maintained.\n</info added on 2025-05-05T01:22:37.630Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-05T01:22:56.734Z>\nThe test strategy for this subtask should be expanded to include Storybook testing. In addition to unit tests that verify the correct number of Letter components are rendered with appropriate props for each animation phase, we should implement Storybook stories to visually test the component behavior.\n\nSpecifically, we should:\n1. Create Storybook stories for each animation phase (idle, deleting, inserting, transitioning)\n2. Include stories that demonstrate both regular and reduced motion modes for accessibility\n3. Add interaction tests in Storybook to verify animation triggers work correctly\n4. Implement visual regression testing using Chromatic or similar tools\n5. Document the testing approach in the component's README\n\nThis comprehensive testing approach will ensure both functional correctness and visual consistency of the Letter components throughout the animation lifecycle.\n</info added on 2025-05-05T01:22:56.734Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-07T22:50:12.580Z>\nBased on the exploration findings, I'll implement the rendering logic for Letter components with proper animation attributes. The implementation will focus on creating a function in WordTransform that maps the transformation plan to Letter components with appropriate animation props.\n\nKey implementation steps:\n1. Create a renderLetters() function in WordTransform that:\n   - Takes the current transformation plan and animation phase as inputs\n   - Maps over the appropriate letter array (source or target) based on the current phase\n   - Assigns unique and stable keys to each letter (combining letter value and position)\n   - Passes appropriate animation props based on the letter's role in the current phase\n   - Calculates staggered delays for smooth sequential animations\n\n2. Use Framer Motion features effectively:\n   - Apply the `layout` prop to Letter components for automatic position transitions\n   - Utilize AnimatePresence for enter/exit animations\n   - Implement custom variants for each animation state (idle, deleting, moving, inserting)\n   - Configure transition properties (duration, ease, delay) for optimal visual effect\n\n3. Add data attributes to each Letter component:\n   - data-phase: Current animation phase (deleting, moving, inserting, complete)\n   - data-letter-state: Letter's specific state (being-deleted, being-moved, being-inserted, idle)\n   - data-letter-index: Original position index for debugging and testing\n\n4. Handle edge cases:\n   - Multiple simultaneous letter operations\n   - Empty strings or single-letter transformations\n   - Proper synchronization with the animation state machine\n\n5. After implementation:\n   - Create comprehensive Storybook stories for each animation phase\n   - Implement visual regression tests\n   - Ensure accessibility compliance with reduced motion mode\n\nI'll ensure the rendering logic correctly switches between source and target letters as appropriate for each phase, maintaining visual consistency throughout the animation sequence.\n</info added on 2025-05-07T22:50:12.580Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-07T22:59:43.789Z>\nThe implementation of the Letter component rendering and animation system has been completed with significant enhancements to ensure optimal performance, accessibility, and visual appeal. The following improvements have been made:\n\n1. Enhanced Letter component with sophisticated animation variants:\n   - Implemented optimized timing and easing functions for each animation state (idle, deleting, inserting, transitioning)\n   - Added subtle bounce effects for insertion and movement animations to improve visual feedback\n   - Integrated prefersReducedMotion media query support to respect user accessibility preferences\n   - Applied performance optimizations including will-change CSS property and GPU acceleration for smoother animations\n\n2. Refined CSS module with comprehensive styling:\n   - Created distinct visual indicators for each animation state to improve user experience\n   - Enhanced accessibility with proper focus states and appropriate contrast ratios\n   - Implemented responsive design principles to ensure consistent appearance across device sizes\n   - Added print styles to ensure appropriate rendering when printed\n   - Optimized rendering performance with CSS containment and other best practices\n\n3. Developed extensive Storybook documentation:\n   - Created stories for each animation state (idle, deleting, inserting, transitioning)\n   - Added interactive controls to demonstrate customization options\n   - Included stories specifically showcasing accessibility features including reduced motion variants\n   - Demonstrated keyboard navigation support and focus management\n   - Provided documentation on component API and usage patterns\n\n4. Implemented comprehensive test coverage:\n   - Unit tests for all animation variants and state transitions\n   - Accessibility tests verifying ARIA attributes and reduced motion compliance\n   - Integration tests ensuring proper interaction with the animation state machine\n   - Visual regression tests to maintain design consistency\n   - Performance tests to prevent animation jank\n\nThe Letter component implementation is now complete and ready for integration with the WordTransform component. The rendering system successfully maps the transformation plan to Letter components with appropriate animation attributes, and the staggered animation system provides a smooth, visually appealing transition between states while maintaining accessibility compliance.\n</info added on 2025-05-07T22:59:43.789Z>",

The following changes were implemented:\n\n1. The complex `createLetterVariants` function was broken down into smaller, focused helper functions:\n   - Created separate functions for each animation state variant (normal, deletion, insertion, movement, exiting)\n   - Implemented a central `getDuration` helper function to handle animation duration calculation logic\n\n2. Extracted utility functions from the component body:\n   - `createDataAttributes` - Generates consistent test and accessibility attributes\n   - `createClassNames` - Constructs CSS class lists based on animation state\n   - `getOutlineColor` - Determines the correct outline color based on component state\n   - `createAnimationCompleteHandler` - Creates a consistent animation completion handler\n\n3. Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for all extracted functions to improve code documentation and developer experience.\n\n4. Added `displayName` to the component for better debugging in React DevTools.\n\n5. Enhanced ARIA support with proper handling of the 'exiting' state.\n\n6. Verified all tests continue to pass with the new implementation.\n\nThis refactoring has significantly improved code maintainability by adhering to the single responsibility principle. Each function now has a clear, specific purpose, and the overall cyclomatic complexity has been reduced below the ESLint threshold of 10. The changes will facilitate future maintenance and optimization of the Letter component.\n</info added on 2025-05-10T02:57:47.508Z>",

The correct plugin has moved to a separate package...\"\n   - Install the correct PostCSS plugin packages: `npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss autoprefixer`\n   - Update the `postcss.config.mjs` file to use proper imports:\n     ```js\n     import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/postcss';\n     import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';\n     \n     export default {\n       plugins: [\n         tailwindcss,\n         autoprefixer,\n       ]\n     };\n     ```\n   - This change follows current best practices for using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS, requiring the dedicated `@tailwindcss/postcss` package rather than directly using `tailwindcss` as a plugin\n6.

      "details": "1. Analyze both implementations:\n   - Compare WordTransform.tsx (original implementation) and WordTransformFSM.tsx (React hooks implementation from Task 16)\n   - Evaluate each based on: performance, maintainability, code clarity, and compatibility with React 19\n   - Document the strengths and weaknesses of each approach\n\n2. Select the superior implementation:\n   - Based on the analysis, the React hooks implementation from Task 16 is likely preferable since it aligns with the project's direction of removing XState dependencies\n   - If the original implementation has features missing in the hooks version, incorporate those features into the selected implementation\n\n3. Consolidation process:\n   - Create a backup branch before making changes\n   - Refactor the chosen implementation to ensure it fully replaces all functionality\n   - Update the component name to be simply \"WordTransform\" regardless of which implementation is chosen\n   - Ensure the component maintains the same props interface for backward compatibility\n\n4. Update references:\n   - Identify all imports and references to both components throughout the codebase\n   - Update all references to use the consolidated component\n   - Pay special attention to the main application page (from Task 7) and any custom hooks that might reference these components\n\n5. Clean up deprecated implementation:\n   - Remove the unused implementation file\n   - Remove associated test files for the deprecated implementation\n   - Remove Storybook stories specific to the deprecated implementation\n   - Update any documentation that references the removed component\n\n6. Verify functionality:\n   - Ensure the consolidated component correctly handles all animation phases (deletions, movements, insertions)\n   - Verify that speed control still works properly\n   - Check that accessibility features are preserved\n\n7. Code quality:\n   - Add comprehensive comments explaining the consolidated implementation\n   - Update TypeScript types as needed\n   - Ensure the code follows project style guidelines",

Unit Testing:\n   - Run existing tests for both components to establish baseline functionality\n   - Update tests for the consolidated component to cover all functionality\n   - Verify that all edge cases are covered (empty strings, identical words, special characters)\n   - Test animation speed control functionality\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Test the consolidated component within the main application\n   - Verify that it interacts correctly with the Controls component\n   - Ensure proper state management between components\n\n3. Visual Regression Testing:\n   - Compare the visual appearance and animation sequence before and after consolidation\n   - Verify that all animation phases (deletions, movements, insertions) work correctly\n   - Test with various word pairs of different lengths and complexity\n\n4. Storybook Testing:\n   - Update or create Storybook stories for the consolidated component\n   - Test different states and configurations in isolation\n   - Verify that the component renders correctly in Storybook\n\n5. Accessibility Testing:\n   - Verify that all accessibility features are preserved\n   - Test with screen readers to ensure animations are properly described\n   - Check keyboard navigation functionality\n\n6. Performance Testing:\n   - Compare rendering performance before and after consolidation\n   - Test with complex word transformations to ensure smooth animations\n   - Verify that there are no memory leaks during repeated animations\n\n7. Browser Compatibility:\n   - Test the consolidated component across different browsers\n   - Verify that animations work consistently across platforms",

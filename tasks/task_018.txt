# Task ID: 18
# Title: Consolidate WordTransform Implementations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve dual implementations by consolidating WordTransform.tsx and WordTransformFSM.tsx into a single component, selecting the better implementation and updating all references while ensuring no functionality is lost.
# Details:
1. Analyze both implementations:
   - Compare WordTransform.tsx (original implementation) and WordTransformFSM.tsx (React hooks implementation from Task 16)
   - Evaluate each based on: performance, maintainability, code clarity, and compatibility with React 19
   - Document the strengths and weaknesses of each approach

2. Select the superior implementation:
   - Based on the analysis, the React hooks implementation from Task 16 is likely preferable since it aligns with the project's direction of removing XState dependencies
   - If the original implementation has features missing in the hooks version, incorporate those features into the selected implementation

3. Consolidation process:
   - Create a backup branch before making changes
   - Refactor the chosen implementation to ensure it fully replaces all functionality
   - Update the component name to be simply "WordTransform" regardless of which implementation is chosen
   - Ensure the component maintains the same props interface for backward compatibility

4. Update references:
   - Identify all imports and references to both components throughout the codebase
   - Update all references to use the consolidated component
   - Pay special attention to the main application page (from Task 7) and any custom hooks that might reference these components

5. Clean up deprecated implementation:
   - Remove the unused implementation file
   - Remove associated test files for the deprecated implementation
   - Remove Storybook stories specific to the deprecated implementation
   - Update any documentation that references the removed component

6. Verify functionality:
   - Ensure the consolidated component correctly handles all animation phases (deletions, movements, insertions)
   - Verify that speed control still works properly
   - Check that accessibility features are preserved

7. Code quality:
   - Add comprehensive comments explaining the consolidated implementation
   - Update TypeScript types as needed
   - Ensure the code follows project style guidelines

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Run existing tests for both components to establish baseline functionality
   - Update tests for the consolidated component to cover all functionality
   - Verify that all edge cases are covered (empty strings, identical words, special characters)
   - Test animation speed control functionality

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the consolidated component within the main application
   - Verify that it interacts correctly with the Controls component
   - Ensure proper state management between components

3. Visual Regression Testing:
   - Compare the visual appearance and animation sequence before and after consolidation
   - Verify that all animation phases (deletions, movements, insertions) work correctly
   - Test with various word pairs of different lengths and complexity

4. Storybook Testing:
   - Update or create Storybook stories for the consolidated component
   - Test different states and configurations in isolation
   - Verify that the component renders correctly in Storybook

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify that all accessibility features are preserved
   - Test with screen readers to ensure animations are properly described
   - Check keyboard navigation functionality

6. Performance Testing:
   - Compare rendering performance before and after consolidation
   - Test with complex word transformations to ensure smooth animations
   - Verify that there are no memory leaks during repeated animations

7. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test the consolidated component across different browsers
   - Verify that animations work consistently across platforms

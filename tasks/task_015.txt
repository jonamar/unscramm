# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Full PWA Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the application with complete Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities including proper manifest, service worker for offline functionality, and install prompt integration.
# Details:
This task involves upgrading the current basic service worker implementation to a fully-featured PWA as specified in the PRD:

1. Web App Manifest Configuration:
   - Create/update manifest.json with proper app name, short_name, description
   - Add complete icon set (192x192, 512x512, maskable icons) in PNG format
   - Configure theme_color and background_color to match the application's design system
   - Set appropriate display mode (standalone) and orientation preferences
   - Include scope and start_url properties

2. Service Worker Enhancement:
   - Implement proper caching strategies using Workbox or similar library
   - Configure precaching for critical assets (HTML, CSS, JS, fonts, core images)
   - Set up runtime caching with appropriate strategies for API calls
   - Implement background sync for offline data submission
   - Add proper error handling and fallbacks for offline scenarios

3. Install Prompt Integration:
   - Complete the implementation of InstallPrompt.tsx component
   - Add logic to detect when the app is installable
   - Implement proper timing for showing the install prompt (not immediate on first visit)
   - Add analytics to track install rates and user engagement
   - Ensure the prompt appears correctly on different browsers and devices

4. Offline Functionality:
   - Ensure the core spell-checking features work without internet connection
   - Implement offline fallbacks for any network-dependent features
   - Add clear user feedback about offline status
   - Test data persistence between online/offline states

5. PWA Metadata and Configuration:
   - Add appropriate meta tags in HTML head for web app capability
   - Configure apple-touch-icon and related iOS-specific metadata
   - Add splash screen configurations for various devices
   - Ensure proper favicon implementation across browsers

6. Next.js Configuration:
   - Update next.config.js with appropriate PWA plugin settings
   - Configure proper asset caching and handling
   - Ensure PWA assets are properly included in the build process

The implementation should follow best practices for PWAs and ensure a seamless user experience regardless of network connectivity.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manifest Validation:
   - Use Chrome DevTools Application tab to verify manifest.json is properly loaded
   - Validate manifest.json using the PWA Builder validator or similar tools
   - Verify all required icons are present and properly sized
   - Check that theme colors match the application design

2. Service Worker Testing:
   - Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to run PWA audit
   - Verify service worker registration in Application tab
   - Test offline functionality by enabling "Offline" mode in DevTools
   - Verify cached resources are being served when offline

3. Install Prompt Testing:
   - Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
   - Verify install prompt appears appropriately on desktop and mobile
   - Test the full installation flow on Android and iOS devices
   - Verify installed app launches correctly with proper splash screen

4. Offline Functionality Verification:
   - Create a test checklist of core features that must work offline
   - Disconnect from network and verify each feature works as expected
   - Test transition between online and offline states
   - Verify data persistence when going offline and back online

5. Cross-Device Testing:
   - Test on multiple device types (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Verify PWA installation on Android and iOS devices
   - Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior
   - Verify splash screen appears correctly on mobile devices

6. Performance Testing:
   - Run Lighthouse PWA audit and achieve score of 90+ 
   - Measure and verify load time improvements with service worker
   - Test startup time of installed PWA vs browser version
   - Verify PWA size is reasonable for installation

Document all test results with screenshots and create a PWA compliance report.

# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate components into main application page
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Assemble the core components into the main application page with proper layout and state management.
# Details:
This task is a critical blocker preventing a working application. The current page.tsx is just a static placeholder with hardcoded inputs and 'Animation will appear here' text. The sophisticated components built in Tasks 5 & 6 are not being used in the running application. You need to replace the placeholder with a fully functional integration of all components.

# Test Strategy:
Test the integrated application with end-to-end tests using Cypress. Verify all user flows work correctly. Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes. Check that state is properly managed between components.

# Subtasks:
## 7.1. Replace placeholder page.tsx with component integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove the static placeholder content and import the WordTransform and Controls components. Set up the basic layout structure according to the design.
### Details:


## 7.2. Implement state management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create state management to connect the Controls and WordTransform components. This should include state for: current word pair, animation status (playing/paused), animation speed, and any other required states from the PRD.
### Details:


## 7.3. Implement manual word entry flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the word input fields from Controls to the state management. Ensure that when users enter new words, the WordTransform component updates accordingly.
### Details:


## 7.4. Implement shuffle functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the shuffle button from Controls to generate random word pairs and update the WordTransform component. Ensure the animation resets when new words are shuffled.
### Details:


## 7.5. Implement play/reset controls [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the play/pause and reset buttons to control the animation state in the WordTransform component. Ensure proper state transitions between playing, paused, and reset states.
### Details:


## 7.6. Implement speed adjustment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the speed control slider to adjust the animation speed in the WordTransform component. Test different speed settings to ensure smooth transitions.
### Details:


## 7.7. Implement responsive layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply responsive styling according to the breakpoints defined in styleguide.md. Test the layout at different viewport sizes to ensure proper component arrangement and scaling.
### Details:


## 7.8. Write end-to-end tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Cypress tests that verify all user flows: manual word entry, shuffle functionality, play/reset controls, and speed adjustment. Test that components interact correctly and state is properly managed.

# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate components into main application page
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Assemble the core components into the main application page with proper layout and state management.
# Details:
This task is a critical blocker preventing a working application. The current page.tsx is just a static placeholder with hardcoded inputs and 'Animation will appear here' text. The sophisticated components built in Tasks 5 & 6 are not being used in the running application. You need to replace the placeholder with a fully functional integration of all components.

# Test Strategy:
Test the integrated application with end-to-end tests using Cypress. Verify all user flows work correctly. Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes. Check that state is properly managed between components.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Replace placeholder page.tsx with component integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove the static placeholder content and import the WordTransform and Controls components. Set up the basic layout structure according to the design.
### Details:


## 2. Implement state management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create state management to connect the Controls and WordTransform components. This should include state for: current word pair, animation status (playing/paused), animation speed, and any other required states from the PRD.
### Details:


## 3. Implement manual word entry flow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the word input fields from Controls to the state management. Ensure that when users enter new words, the WordTransform component updates accordingly.
### Details:


## 4. Implement shuffle functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 13
### Description: Connect the shuffle button from Controls to generate random word pairs and update the WordTransform component. Ensure the animation resets when new words are shuffled.
### Details:


## 5. Implement play/reset controls [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the play/pause and reset buttons to control the animation state in the WordTransform component. Ensure proper state transitions between playing, paused, and reset states.
### Details:


## 6. Implement speed adjustment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the speed control slider to adjust the animation speed in the WordTransform component. Test different speed settings to ensure smooth transitions.
### Details:


## 7. Implement responsive layout [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply responsive styling according to the breakpoints defined in styleguide.md. Test the layout at different viewport sizes to ensure proper component arrangement and scaling.

RESPONSIVE LAYOUT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- Verified existing responsive breakpoints in globals.css match styleguide requirements
- Enhanced page.tsx with improved responsive Tailwind classes for better mobile layout
- Added responsive image sizing with w-40 to w-56 scaling across breakpoints
- Improved Controls component responsive CSS with additional mobile-specific optimizations
- Implemented all required breakpoints:
  * 600px (stack inputs)
  * 500px (1.6rem letters)
  * 400px (1.3rem letters)
  * 320px (1.1rem letters)
  * 350px (smaller buttons)
  * height 600px (reduced padding)
- Layout tested and working across all viewport sizes per styleguide requirements

## 8. Write end-to-end tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Cypress tests that verify all user flows: manual word entry, shuffle functionality, play/reset controls, and speed adjustment. Test that components interact correctly and state is properly managed.
